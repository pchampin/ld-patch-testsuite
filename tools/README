This directory contain tools for maintaining the testsuite.
It is not required by developers wanting to use the testsuite,
as all generated files are (meant to be) committed in the repository.

- Makefile
  run all the automation scripts

- tr-turtle-manifest.py
  assuming that turtle/ contains the turtle test suite,
  convert turtle/manifest.ttl into turtle/manifest-ldpatch.ttl
  and produces all the necessary files.

- gen-variants.py 
  generates variants for syntax tests (of the form s_*.ldpatch):
  - Add → A, AddNew, AN, Delete, D, DeleteExisting, DE
  - Cut → C
  - UpdateList → UL
  - Bind → B

- gen-syntax-manifest.py
  generates the manifest-syntax.ttl file,
  creating a test for each ldpatch file of the form s_*.ldpatch
  (s_bad_*.ldpatch denoting NegativeSyntaxTest)

- check.py
  checks that
  - all ldpatch/ttl/nt files are referenced in a manifest file
  - all test resource present in manifest files are referenced in mf:entries 
  - all test resources have a name consistent with their IRI fragment

- gen-reports-README.py
  generates the README.rst file in the reports/ directory.
